# Introduction
Racism and racial injustices have been fairly popular and debated topic in social and political structures of the federal government. This is most apparent in the United States' prison system where a disproportionate racial incarceration is very visible. Therefore, in the data given by Vera Institute regarding incarceration trends, there will be a focus on 5 variable to expose the patterns of inequality.
1. One variable to focus on in the data set is `county_name` which returns the location of imprisonment.
2. The second variable to focus on is the `total_jail_pop` which is the estimate average number of people held in jail for a whole year.
3. The third variable is `black_jail_pop`
4. The fourth variable is `white_jail_pop`
5. The fifth variable is `region`
Where does the region that you live in affect racial incarceration?
